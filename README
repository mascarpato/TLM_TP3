Practical work 3 - Integration of embedded system
This practical work consisted of taking a look into two simulation approaches.
The first one was the ISS simulation (instruction set simulator). In this case the simulator interprets every instruction as 
if it was really running on the system.
The second approach consisted of simulating the Game of Life running on the real platform (native simulation).
We can already expect during the early stages of the development that the native simulation will be considerably faster than 
the iss.

Some part of the work involved modifying the makefiles needed to run both simulations. Once they were executing correctly, we
only filled up the missing parts of the code with the proper instructions. So we have not done any extra work other than that
specifically required by the practical work's specification.

After we finished both implementations we watched them run at the same time for approximately ten minutes. This way we could 
see how the native simulation was faster than the iss. While the game of life was still going through its early stages in the
iss simulation, the game of life in the native simulation was already in a much more advanced stage.
